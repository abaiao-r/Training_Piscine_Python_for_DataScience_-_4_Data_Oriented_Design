# Data_Oriented_Design

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing data-oriented design principles in Python through a series of exercises. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and readability of code by utilizing functions, decorators, and data classes. This project emphasizes the importance of writing clean, maintainable code while applying statistical and mathematical operations.

## Why is Relevant?
Hands-on experience with data-oriented design is crucial for developing efficient software applications. This project provides practical skills in structuring code, managing function calls, and utilizing data classes to represent complex data structures. Understanding these concepts is essential for any aspiring software developer or data scientist, as they contribute to better performance and maintainability of code.

## Skills
- Data-Oriented Design
- Function Management
- Decorators
- Data Classes
- Statistical Analysis

## Exercises
### Exercise 01: Calculate My Statistics
- **Description**: This exercise involves creating a function that calculates statistical measures such as mean, median, quartiles, standard deviation, and variance from a variable number of arguments. The function also manages errors gracefully.
- **Relevance**: Understanding statistical calculations is fundamental in data science, enabling the analysis of datasets and extraction of meaningful insights.

### Exercise 02: Outer_Inner
- **Description**: In this exercise, functions are created to return the square and exponentiation of a number. Additionally, a higher-order function is implemented that returns an object capable of performing repeated calculations based on the provided function.
- **Relevance**: This exercise reinforces the concepts of higher-order functions and closures, showcasing how to create flexible and reusable code structures.

### Exercise 03: My First Decorating
- **Description**: This exercise involves writing a decorator that limits the number of times a function can be called. The decorator manages the call count and raises an error if the limit is exceeded.
- **Relevance**: Understanding decorators is crucial for enhancing function behavior without modifying the original function, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.

### Exercise 04: Data Class
- **Description**: This exercise requires the creation of a data class to represent a student, including attributes for name, nickname, and a randomly generated ID. The class ensures that certain attributes are not directly modifiable upon instantiation.
- **Relevance**: Utilizing data classes simplifies the management of complex data structures, making code more readable and maintainable.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable practical experience in data-oriented design, emphasizing the importance of clean and efficient code structure. Participants gain insights into statistical analysis, function management, and the use of data classes, enhancing their ability to develop scalable and maintainable software solutions.
